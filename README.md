# Train-data-generator-for-AI-rubik-solver
A simple program that generates bmp pictures with rubik cubes that can be used by an AI to learn rubik faces recognition

The application needs a folder with backgrounds (saved as .bmp) and it will paste above each a 3-D rubik, of random(uniform distributed) size, on a random(uniform distributed) location in picture, random(poisson distributed) andgles of rotation, random(uniform distributed) stickers color(White, Yellow, Orange, Red, Green, Blue), and random(unifirm distributed) separators siezes and colors between stickers.
